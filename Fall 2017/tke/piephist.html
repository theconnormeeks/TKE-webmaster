  Pi-Epsilon Chapter was founded as an interest group led by John Huffman in the fall of 1979. After initially petitioning to join the Kappa Alpha Order (KA), the group decided to become an affiliate of Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity. On October 20, 1979, the group was recognized as a colony Tau Kappa Epsilon. Its big brother chapter was Beta Psi at Arkansas State University. A twincolony was also established at Memphis State University. During the next two years, Pi-Epsilon was able to maintain successful membership drives and become a full chapter on January 10, 1981. We were the first chapter to join TKE in the 1980's. Prior to this, the Memphis State Colony was closed down. We also held our first Toga Party in 1981. Pi-Epsilon Chapter hosted a 1982 District Conference at CBU, and one of our fraters participated in the national Keg Roll across the United States. In 1983, a Pi Kappa Phi Colony was established at CBU, and our days of being the only fraternity on campus were over. TKE had a tremendous year in 1983: the first Red Carnation Ball was held, we captured first place in intramurals, we beat Pi Kappa Phi in rush, and we received our first SUPERIOR CHAPTERaward from national. In 1984 and 1985, TKE continued to be strong in intramurals, but we began having trouble with rush. Our membership dipped to around 25, and we were in need of a successful rush. While we maintained a mediocre chapter size, we kept expanding our social calendar, and won awards for our parties each year. We also began to establish relations with our alumni. In 1986, our first ever TIKI ISLAND was held, our over-emphasis on parties, however, led to a crumbling effect on everything else. In 1987, our chapter size remained small; we began losing badly in intramurals, and our grades were extremely poor. We did, however, begin to establish our history of dominating community service with our own Keg Roll that raised $3000 for St. Jude. In 1988, we finally had a successful rush. Pi Kappa Phi was still way ahead of us, but we stabilized the chapter size at about 40. The Dream Factory was voted upon in February of 1988 as the new local philanthropy, and we have raised over $5000 for them and performed numerous projects ever since. Later that year we held our first Christmas Ball. In 1989, SAE came on campus, and it looked like we had our work cut out for us in rush. We rose to the occasion and finished first in rush for the first time since 1984. We also were awarded our second Superior Chapter award. Our Alumni Association was born, and they would begin providing their many resources. In 1990, we began implementing the new member program as well as the FIPG regulations. TKE was the first fraternity to try a no pledging style of initiation. In it, new members were initiated within two weeks of rush week, and then only had to pass the educational class to get full membership. TKE tried this program for two years but decided that the quick initiation was counterproductive to new member development and went to a six-week pledge period. We also finished first in rush for the second straight year, and also won another Superior Chapter award. Also, in 1990, we captured the highest fraternity GPA award. Frater Ronald Reagan visited Pi-Epsilon chapter while in Memphis and signed our scroll as 189. 1991 was sad year for TKE. Brother Tony Pisano, a founder, faculty advisor, and Board of Trustees member, passed away. A memorial stone and tree were placed outside the Rozier dorm and remains there today. 1992 started off well for TKE. We initiated two regular members and one honorary member in the spring. In the fall, a class of 12 members was initiated. Included in this class were two legacy members, the first of the chapter’s history. In 1993, membership dropped as rush went bad. However, under the leadership of an organized executive council, TKE won a superior chapter and the TOP TEKE CHAPTER award. Encouraged by our national award, 1994 was one of the best years for Pi-Epsilon. In the spring of 1994, we held the first annual Night of Life. This event, co-sponsored by ZTA, help raise over $2,000 for the Dream Factory of Memphis. We also improved vastly in membership, relations with sororities, and other intangible aspects. This new spirit continued into 1995 in which the second annual Night of Life again raised over $1,500 dollars for the Dream Factory with the help of ZTA. In 1997, TKE and AZD joined together for Night of Life, a union which would continue until 1999. Scroll number 300 was reached in 1998. And in 1999, Pi-Epsilon chapter was named as an Alumni Leadership Chapter and an Apollo Chapter for our hard work both on and off campus as well as our alumni relations. 2000 marked a changing in times for TKE at CBU. ZTA joined Pi-Epsilon chapter to raise money for the annual Night of Life in a night of events that lived up to the occation's name. With the impending loss of 13 actives in the spring of 2001, we had to rush hard in the fall. After all the hard work and preparation, we finished first in rush and initiated 17 brothers in the fall. Some of our newly initiated included the brother of an alumni, a cousin of an active, and the son of Pi Kappa Phi’s Chapter Moderator. Spring of 2001 saw such events as the raising of over $5000 for the Dream Factory of Memphis with the ladies of AZD, this donation was used to grant a dream to a lucky child. Also for this year, members of TKE were elected to President of the Student Government Association, Vice President of Finance of the SGA and two seats in the Senate.
