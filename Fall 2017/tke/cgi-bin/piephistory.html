                  <P>Pi-Epsilon Chapter was founded as an interest group led by 
                  John Huffman in the fall of 1979.&nbsp; After initially 
                  petitioning to join the Kappa Alpha Order (KA), the group 
                  decided to become an affiliate of Tau Kappa Epsilon 
                  Fraternity.&nbsp; On October 20, 1979, the group was 
                  recognized as a colony Tau Kappa Epsilon.&nbsp; Its big 
                  brother chapter was Beta Psi at Arkansas State 
                  University.&nbsp; A "twin" colony was also established at 
                  Memphis State University. </P>
                  <P>During the next two years, Pi-Epsilon was able to maintain 
                  successful membership drives and become a full chapter on 
                  January 10, 1981.&nbsp; We were the first chapter to join TKE 
                  in the 1980's. Prior to this, the Memphis State Colony was 
                  closed down.&nbsp; We also held our first Toga Party in 1981. 
                  </P>
                  <P>Pi-Epsilon Chapter hosted a 1982 District Conference at 
                  CBU, and one of our fraters participated in the national Keg 
                  Roll across the United States.&nbsp; In 1983, a Pi Kappa Phi 
                  Colony was established at CBU, and our days of being the only 
                  fraternity on campus were over.&nbsp; TKE had a tremendous 
                  year in 1983: the first Red Carnation Ball was held, we 
                  captured first place in intramurals, we beat Pi Kappa Phi in 
                  rush, and we received our first "SUPERIOR CHAPTER" award from 
                  national. </P>
                  <P>In 1984 and 1985, TKE continued to be strong in 
                  intramurals, but we began having trouble with rush.&nbsp; Our 
                  membership dipped to around 25, and we were in need of a 
                  successful rush.&nbsp; While we maintained a mediocre chapter 
                  size, we kept expanding our social calendar, and won awards 
                  for our parties each year.&nbsp; We also began to establish 
                  relations with our alumni. </P>
                  <P>In 1986, our first ever TIKI ISLAND was held, our 
                  over-emphasis on parties, however, led to a crumbling effect 
                  on everything else. </P>
                  <P>In 1987, our chapter size remained small; we began losing 
                  badly in intramurals, and our grades were extremely 
                  poor.&nbsp; We did, however, begin to establish our history of 
                  dominating community service with our own Keg Roll that raised 
                  $3000 for St. Jude. </P>
                  <P>In 1988, we finally had a successful rush.&nbsp; Pi Kappa 
                  Phi was still way ahead of us, but we stabilized the chapter 
                  size at about 40.&nbsp; The Dream Factory was voted upon in 
                  February of 1988 as the new local philanthropy, and we have 
                  raised over $5000 for them and performed numerous projects 
                  ever since. Later that year we held our first Christmas Ball. 
                  </P>
                  <P>In 1989, SAE came on campus, and it looked like we had our 
                  work cut out for us in rush.&nbsp; We rose to the occasion and 
                  finished first in rush for the first time since 1984.&nbsp; We 
                  also were awarded our second " Superior Chapter" award.&nbsp; 
                  Our Alumni Association was born, and they would begin 
                  providing their many resources. </P>
                  <P>In 1990, we began implementing the new member program as 
                  well as the FIPG regulations.&nbsp; TKE was the first 
                  fraternity to try a "no pledging" style of initiation.&nbsp; 
                  In it, new members were initiated within two weeks of rush 
                  week, and then only had to pass the educational class to get 
                  full membership.&nbsp; TKE tried this program for two years 
                  but decided that the quick initiation was counterproductive to 
                  new member development and went to a six-week pledge 
                  period.&nbsp; We also finished first in rush for the second 
                  straight year, and also won another Superior Chapter 
                  award.&nbsp; Also, in 1990, we captured the highest fraternity 
                  GPA award.&nbsp; Frater Ronald Reagan visited Pi-Epsilon 
                  chapter while in Memphis and signed our scroll as 189. </P>
                  <P>1991 was sad year for TKE.&nbsp; Brother Tony Pisano, a 
                  founder, faculty advisor, and Board of Trustees member, passed 
                  away.&nbsp; A memorial stone and tree were placed outside the 
                  Rozier dorm and remains there today. </P>
                  <P>1992 started off well for TKE.&nbsp; We initiated two 
                  regular members and one honorary member in the spring.&nbsp; 
                  In the fall, a class of 12 members was initiated.&nbsp; 
                  Included in this class were two "legacy" members, the first of 
                  the chapter’s history. </P>
                  <P>In 1993, membership dropped as rush went bad.&nbsp; 
                  However, under the leadership of an organized executive 
                  council, TKE won a superior chapter and the TOP TEKE CHAPTER 
                  award. </P>
                  <P>Encouraged by our national award, 1994 was one of the best 
                  years for Pi-Epsilon.&nbsp; In the spring of 1994, we held the 
                  first annual "Night of Life."&nbsp; This event, co-sponsored 
                  by ZTA, help raise over $2,000 for the Dream Factory of 
                  Memphis.&nbsp; We also improved vastly in membership, 
                  relations with sororities, and other intangible aspects. 
<br>This new spirit continued into 1995 in 
                  which the second annual "Night of Life" again raised over 
                  $1,500 dollars for the Dream Factory with the help of ZTA. 
</P>
                  <P>In 1997, TKE and AZD joined together for "Night of Life," a 
                  union which would continue until 1999.&nbsp; Scroll number 300 
                  was reached in 1998.&nbsp; And in 1999, Pi-Epsilon chapter was 
                  named as an Alumni Leadership Chapter and an Apollo Chapter 
                  for our hard work both on and off campus as well as our alumni 
                  relations. </P>
                  <P>2000 marked a changing in times for TKE at CBU.&nbsp; ZTA 
                  joined Pi-Epsilon chapter to raise money for the annual "Night 
                  of Life" in a night of events that lived up to the occation's 
                  name.&nbsp; With the impending loss of 13 actives in the 
                  spring of 2001, we had to rush hard in the fall.&nbsp; After 
                  all the hard work and preparation, we finished first in rush 
                  and initiated 17 brothers in the fall.&nbsp; Some of our newly 
                  initiated included the brother of an alumni, a cousin of an 
                  active, and the son of Pi Kappa Phi’s Chapter Moderator. </P>
                  <P>Spring of 2001 saw such events as the raising of over $5000 
                  for the Dream Factory of Memphis with the ladies of AZD, this 
                  donation was used to grant a dream to a lucky child.&nbsp; 
                  Also for this year, members of TKE were elected to President 
                  of the Student Government Association, Vice President of 
                  Finance of the SGA and two seats in the Senate. </P>
