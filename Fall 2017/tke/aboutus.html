<p>Letter from the Prytanis, </p><br />
<p>The Pi-Epsilon Chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon at Christian Brothers University has played a pivotal role in establishing and enhancing what it means to promote leadership, scholarship and fellowship within the Memphis community as a whole. From its humble beginnings: starting as a colony on the 20th of October 1979, to eventually receiving its charter on January 10, 1981, Tau Kappa Epsilon has lived out its core values of Love, Charity, and Esteem thus making Tau Kappa Epsilon the first and oldest Fraternity at Christian Brothers University.<br /><br />
  The Pi-Epsilon Chapter has strived to unleash each member's potential and fulfill the International Fraternity's mission statement of truly making better men for a better world. The proud history speaks for itself in terms of the massive efforts that TKE has made to make a difference. The chapter has won the International Top Teke award on six separate occasions; furthermore Pi-Epsilon was the first TKE chapter to win the TKE National Tournament with a little over $36,000 raised for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Pi-Epsilon's donation made up 46% of the entire money raised during the tournament. Consistently, Pi-Epsilon is recognized as one of the best TKE chapters being regularly awarded for Excellence in Achievement for Academic Success, Extracurricular Activities, Alumni Relations, Community Service, and Chapter Size. In Tau Kappa Epsilon, there are evident lifetime opportunities for growth, leadership, and to become better men for a better world. <br /><br />
  The Fraters of the Pi-Epsilon Chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity continue to live a life guided by Love, Charity and Esteem and are willing to assume the responsibility to maintain the high standards of excellence set by those before them. The lifelong bond of brotherhood that Tau Kappa Epsilon provides is one that fosters growth and this is effectively portrayed by the words of the 40th President of the United States of America and TKE Alumnus, so I leave you with this:<br /><br />
   "I am proud to be a Teke. For me, TKE has not only been an enjoyable association, but also a meaningful aspect of my life since I joined in 1929." - President Ronald Reagan (Iota Chapter, Eureka College) </p><br />
