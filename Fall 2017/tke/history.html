<p><STRONG>Our Beginning, Growth, and 
                  Development </STRONG>
<p>On the cold night of January 10, 1899, 
                  students of Illinois Wesleyan university in the small 
                  midwestern town of Bloomington had just returned from the 
                  Christmas holidays when Joseph L. Settles went to the room 
                  occupied by James C. McNutt and Clarence A. Mayer at 504 East 
                  Locust Street to propound organization of a new society on 
                  campus. Joined immediately by Owen I. Truitt and Roy 
                  C.Atkinson, these five men then drew up the first set of 
                  regulations for the Knights of Classic Lore, a society whose 
                  avowed purpose was "to aid college men in mental, moral, and 
                  social development." 
                  
<p>Because of his late arrival for this 
                  meeting, James J. Love was made the first new member after 
                  which George A. Thorpe, Edwin A. Palmer, and he, became the 
                  first initiates of this new organization. Although Settles was 
                  the leader in organizing the society, Atkinson was elected 
                  President and McNutt was chosen as Secretary. 
                  

<p>There were two fraternities already in 
                  existence at Illinois Wesleyan in 1899, both with more than 50 
                  chapters nationally. Phi Gamma Delta had been established at 
                  IWU in 1866, while Sigma Chi had begun there in 1883. In 
                  addition, two other national fraternities- Phi Delta Theta and 
                  Delta Tau Delta- had inactive chapters at Illinois Wesleyan, 
                  the Phi Delts existing from 1878-1897 and the Delts from 
                  1877-1880. 
                  
<p><STRONG>A "Different" Organization 
                  </STRONG>
<p>The founders of the Knights of Classic 
                  Lore, however, desired an organization different from that 
                  represented by the existing fraternities. Their desire was to 
                  establish a fraternity in which the primary requisites for 
                  membership would be the personal worth and character of the 
                  individual rather than the wealth he possessed, the honors or 
                  titles he could display, or the rank he maintained on the 
                  social ladder. The snobbery and disdain for persons outside 
                  their fraternity- a common characteristic of many fraternities 
                  at this time- was regarded with disfavor by the founders of 
                  KCL. 
                  
<p>It was not long after their recognition 
                  on campus, however, that the Knights of Classic Lore were 
                  approached by some of the alumni of the Illinois Epsilon 
                  chapter of Phi Delta Theta, whose charter had been surrendered 
                  in 1897. The Phi Delt alumni saw in this new group an 
                  opportunity for the restoration of its charter and, 
                  accordingly, interested themselves in converting it into a 
                  strong local fraternity. Through the persuasion and effort of 
                  Richard Henry Little, a columnist on the Chicago Tribune and 
                  one of the most prominent Phi Delt alumni, the Knights of 
                  Classic Lore presented a petition to the Phi Delta Theta 
                  national organization at its convention in New York in 1902. 
                  The petition was rejected. 
                  
<p>In order that their organization might 
                  be more attractive to Phi Delta Theta, it was decided that a 
                  Greek-letter name should be adopted. The name "Knights of 
                  Classic Lore" was therefore abandoned and the Greek Letters 
                  Tau Kappa Epsilon selected. As a further step, a fraternity 
                  house was rented. It is significant that this was the first 
                  fraternity house at Illinois Wesleyan although Phi Gamma Delta 
                  and Sigma Chi had been in existence on campus for many years. 
                  The Wilder Mansion, former home of President Wilder of the 
                  University, became the first TKE house. 
                  
<p>In the ensuing years, the Phi Delt 
                  alumni and some of the undergraduate members continued to 
                  press for affiliation with Phi Delta Theta with petitions 
                  being presented at the 1904 and 1906 Phi Delt national 
                  convention. In each instance, however, the petition was either 
                  withdrawn or postponed. It is reported that one of the 
                  petitions came within one vote of being accepted. 
                  
<p><STRONG>The Great Decision </STRONG>
<p>Late in 1907, several undergraduate 
                  members of Tau Kappa Epsilon were again preparing a petition 
                  to be presented to the 1908 Phi Delta Theta national 
                  convention. The wisdom of petitioning, however, was being 
                  questioned with increasing frequency. To arouse enthusiasm for 
                  this fourth attempt, a banquet was held on October 19, 1907, 
                  at which speeches were made- both advocating and questioning 
                  the proposal. One of the most notable and influential speeches 
                  given was a blistering address by Wallace G. McCauley, titled 
                  "Opportunity out of Defeat," in which he advocated the 
                  abandonment of the petitioning policy and the substitution of 
                  a campaign to become a national. Although arousing bitter 
                  opposition at the time, this speech ultimately reduced the 
                  fourth petition to a bare formality and became one of the 
                  significant turning points in the history of the fraternity. 
                  
<p>One of the measures advocated by 
                  McCauley in his address was the publication of a quarterly 
                  magazine called THE TEKE. This proposal met with immediate 
                  approval and the first issue was published in January, 1908, 
                  with Clyde M. Leach as the editor. 
                  
<p><STRONG>The First Conclave </STRONG>
<p>Under the new constitution the Prytanis 
                  and Grammateus of the undergraduate chapters were ex-officio 
                  delegates to the Conclave of the Grand Chapter, and 
                  accordingly, on February 17, 1909, Clyde M. Leach as Prytanis 
                  and Orrie Reeser as Grammateus of the Alpha chapter, met in 
                  Leach's room in the chapter house at 801 North Main Street and 
                  held the first Conclave of the Grand Chapter, electing a full 
                  slate of national officers and appointing a committee to 
                  revise the ritual. 
                  
<p>The first Grand Officers were: Grand 
                  Prytanis, Lester H. Martin; Grand Epiprytanis, William Wilson; 
                  Grand Grammateus, Clyde E. Leighty; Grand Histor, L.W. 
                  Tuesburg; Grand Crysophylos, James J. Love; Grand Hypophetes, 
                  Arthur A. Heinlein, and Grand Pylortes, Clyde H. Meyers. The 
                  office of Grand Hegemon was not to be created until the 1951 
                  Conclave. 
                  
<p><STRONG>Growth Begins </STRONG>

<p>As has been typical of Tau Kappa 
                  Epsilon throughout its history, the leaders of the fraternity 
                  did not waver but pressed forward toward their goal to build 
                  TKE into a strong national fraternity. Approximately two 
                  months after the national constitution was ratified, the 
                  second, or Beta, chapter was installed. 
                  
<p>On April 6, 1909 Lester H. Martin, 
                  Arthur Heinlein, and L.W. Tuesburg, plus a delegation of 
                  actives from Alpha Chapter, paid a visit to Chi Rho Sigma, a 
                  local fraternity at Millikin University, Decatur, Illinois. 
                  The Grand Prytanis appointed a committee to investigate the 
                  local further, and when the committee reported favorably, the 
                  first petition was written with pen and ink on a piece of 
                  Decatur YMCA stationary and unanimously approved by the Grand 
                  Council. 
                  
<p>Beta Chapter was installed on Saturday, 
                  April 17, 1909, at Decatur, Illinois. A banquet was held that 
                  evening at the Decatur Hotel attended by members of Alpha 
                  Chapter and TKE alumni. It is significant to note that from 
                  the very beginning petitioning groups were thoroughly 
                  investigated and that an installation banquet was held. These 
                  policies have been followed without exception since. 
                  
<p><STRONG>The Second Conclave </STRONG>
<p>The second Conclave was also held in 
                  the Alpha chapter house at 801 North Main in Bloomington on 
                  February 11-12, 1910. The Grand Officers, plus two delegates 
                  each from Alpha and Beta Chapters, were in attendance. Alpha 
                  Chapter staged a banquet on Friday evening, February 11, for 
                  those attending and a smoker was held on Saturday evening at 
                  the close of the Conclave. Business was transacted with all 
                  the seriousness of a large meeting, and Lester H. Martin was 
                  again elected Grand Prytanis. 
                  
<p>In the Spring of 1910, it was announced 
                  that Alpha Chapter, after living 11 years in a rented house, 
                  had purchased the home of a Wesleyan professor at the cost of 
                  $8,500. This, the first house ever owned by a fraternity at 
                  Illinois Wesleyan, was located at 406 East Walnut Street, and 
                  served as the home of the chapter until the fall of 1924. 
                  
<p>On February 10-11, 1911, the third 
                  Conclave convened at Decatur, Illinois, with the Grand 
                  Officers and delegates from Alpha and Beta again in 
                  attendance. William Wilson was elected Grand Prytanis. 
                  
<p><STRONG>The Triangle is Formed 
</STRONG>
<p>The issues of THE TEKE magazine during 
                  1910-1911 were filled with articles urging further expansion 
                  of the fraternity and predicting the bright future of this 
                  infant national. Wallace G. McCauley, in the January, 1910 
                  issue stated: &nbsp; &nbsp; 
                  
<p>&nbsp;"TKE is bound to become the 
                  fraternity. It is written in the &nbsp; stars that way and all 
                  powers of established Hellenism cannot &nbsp; stop the onward 
                  destiny of Tau Kappa Epsilon. I don't believe in &nbsp; 
                  limiting its extension. Let us plant a chapter where there is 
                  a &nbsp; proper membership to promote its principles." 
                  

<p>Early in 1912, three alumni of Alpha 
                  Chapter- Henry A. Burd, Wilbur R. Leighty, and Ward H. Sachs- 
                  were graduate students at the University of Illinois. Mainly 
                  through their efforts, a local fraternity know as the Campus 
                  Club petitioned Tau Kappa Epsilon for a charter, the petition 
                  being presented on January 22, 1912. The charter was granted 
                  and installation followed on February 3, 1912, not at 
                  Champaign, but at the Alpha chapter house in Bloomington. 
                  
<p>The significance if the location of 
                  these first three chapters, closely approximating an 
                  equilateral triangle on the map, was at once realized and has 
                  been symbolized ever since by the traditional position and 
                  shape of the badge. Because of the geographical significance 
                  of these three chapters, consideration was given to cutting 
                  off any further growth. 
                  
<p><STRONG>The Triangle is Broken 
</STRONG>
<p>Such sentiment was short lived, 
                  however, and by late 1912 the triangle had been broken by an 
                  unnamed group at Knox College in Galesburg Illinois. Through 
                  the leadership of John Gehlmann, Delta Chapter was installed 
                  on November 22, 1912. 
                  
<p>Earlier in the year, on February 9-10, 
                  the fourth Conclave had been held at Bloomington with Gamma 
                  Chapter represented for the first time. This Conclave order a 
                  revision of the ritual, provided for inspection of chapters, 
                  created the very important Judiciary Committee, created the 
                  system of traditions, amended the constitution to give each 
                  Past Grand Prytanis life membership in the Grand Chapter, and 
                  approved the former associate member button. 
                  
<p>The fifth Conclave, held in Decatur, 
                  Illinois, on February 14-15, 1913, saw the election of L.W. 
                  Tuesburg as Grand Prytanis. Tuesburg, a loyal servant 
                  throughout the history of TKE, was re-elected Grand Prytanis 
                  by the sixth Conclave on April 17-18, 1914, held in Champaign, 
                  Illinois. At this Conclave the first complete code of 
                  fraternity laws was enacted under Frater Tuesburg's 
                  leadership. 
                  
<p><STRONG>Out of Illinois </STRONG>
<p>When the Knights of Classic Lore was 
                  founded in 1899 there were no thoughts of ever leaving the 
                  bounds of that state. This feeling was still present during 
                  the initial expansion among several of the alumni and active 
                  members of the fraternity. As a result, following the 
                  installation of Delta Chapter in 1912, no new chapters were 
                  chartered for more than two and one-half years. 
                  
<p>Voluminous correspondence was carried 
                  on with numerous prospects during this time, however, and a 
                  group at Iowa State College in Ames determined, as early as 
                  1913, to petition TKE for a charter as soon as faculty 
                  permission could be secured. 
                  
<p>One of the first acts of the new Grand 
                  Prytanis, Lyle F. Straight, elected at the seventh Conclave in 
                  Galesburg, Illinois, April 16-17, 1915, was to receive a 
                  petition from this group, known as the Seminoles. The 
                  Seminoles were installed as Epsilon Chapter on May 28, 1915, 
                  as the leadership of the fraternity overcame any desire for 
                  provincialism. With this event, Tau Kappa Epsilon may be said 
                  to have acquired a truly national scope. With five chapters, 
                  TKE was eligible for membership in the National 
                  Interfraternity Council and was admitted as a senior member on 
                  November 27, 1915. Tau Kappa Epsilon had, for the first time, 
                  crossed the borders of Illinois; had been admitted into the 
                  councils of national fraternities; and had completed a period 
                  of slow development. 
                  
<p>In six years, TKE had added but four 
                  chapters. In the next two years, however, five additional 
                  chapters were admitted into the fraternity. The chapters 
                  chartered were: Zeta at Coe College, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, May 
                  21, 1916; Eta at the University of Chicago, February 17, 1917; 
                  Theta at the University of Minnesota, March 10, 1917; Iota at 
                  Eureka College, Eureka, Illinois, April 21, 1917; and Kappa at 
                  Beloit College, Beloit, Wisconsin, May 12, 1917. 
                  
<p>The eighth Conclave convened at 
                  Bloomington, April 28-29, 1916, and re-elected Frater Straight 
                  was Grand Prytanis. On April 27-28, 1917, the month of 
                  America's entry into the First World War, the ninth Conclave 
                  was held at Ames, Iowa. Oscar G. Hoose was chosen as Grand 
                  Prytanis. The minutes of the Conclave gave no mention of the 
                  approaching conflict save a single resolution "embodying the 
                  spirit of the fraternity with respect to the war situation." 
                  
<p><STRONG>World War I </STRONG>
<p>Up to this time the history of the 
                  fraternity, marked only by its annual Conclaves and the 
                  chartering of new chapters, had been merely a somewhat routine 
                  record of slow, steady growth in numbers, chapter rolls and 
                  fraternity consciousness. This period also brought about the 
                  accretion of a body of laws and traditions, the development of 
                  a ritual and a general welding together of its membership into 
                  a homogenous fellowship. 
                  

<p>With the entry of the United States 
                  into World War I and its accompanying transformation of the 
                  colleges into the Student's Army Training Corps, fraternity 
                  activities on every campus were practically suspended for more 
                  than a year. The enactment of the emergency war legislation, 
                  most of which became permanent, began a trend, ever since 
                  continuing, toward a strong centralized national organization 
                  and, at the same time, a compact yet rapidly expanding 
                  fraternity. 
                  
<p><STRONG>Tex Flint Elected </STRONG>
<p>If the 1917 Conclave was not war 
                  conscious, the tenth, held in Chicago, April 26-27, 1918, 
                  concerned itself with little else than the war and its campus 
                  problems. Frater Hoose declined re-election because he 
                  expected to enter the service and Harrold P. 'Tex' Flint was 
                  elected to the first of three terms as Grand Prytanis. Much 
                  emergency legislation was enacted, such as the creation of 
                  regions and regional officers and Chapter Advisors, and the 
                  definition of their duties, the suspension of second-semester 
                  initiations, and the granting to the alumni the right of 
                  active participation in chapter affairs whenever the number of 
                  undergraduate members fell below ten. 
                  
<p>The record of Tau Kappa Epsilon in 
                  World War I was most creditable. Many men saw active service 
                  both at home and in Europe, while scores were enrolled in the 
                  S.A.T.C. At the tenth Conclave in Chicago, April 26-27, 1918, 
                  it was revealed that Tau Kappa Epsilon had a total membership 
                  of 702- 173 active members and 529 alumni. Of the alumni, 204 
                  or 38 1/2 percent were directly involved in the war effort. 
                  
<p>The years 1919 and 1920 witnessed two 
                  rather uneventful Conclaves, the eleventh, at Beloit, and the 
                  twelfth, at Minneapolis, and the chartering of Mu, Nu, and Xi 
                  chapters. The Akela Club, at the University of Wisconsin, had 
                  become Lambda Chapter in 1918, the only wartime acquisition. 
                  Mu Chapter originated from Sigma Alpha Phi, a local at Carroll 
                  College, Waukesha, Wisconsin. 
                  
<p><STRONG>To The West Coast </STRONG>
<p>The installation of Nu Chapter at the 
                  University of California marked a significant step in the 
                  history of Tau Kappa Epsilon, a step that was taken only after 
                  considerable discussion and misgiving. The Sequoyah Club at 
                  the University of California had presented two earlier 
                  petitions which were turned down because of the distance 
                  between the 12 chapters that were then concentrated in 
                  Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. The third petition, 
                  however, proved successful and TKE took a long leap 
                  geographically, obtaining a foothold on the shores of the 
                  Pacific. 
                  
<p>Phi Omega, a local fraternity at 
                  Washington University in St. Louis, was granted a charter as 
                  Xi Chapter by the Minneapolis Conclave. 
                  
<p>Tau Kappa Epsilon passed through the 
                  war crisis and restored all of its chapters to complete 
                  activity, a remarkable achievement for such a young struggling 
                  fraternity. As the first decade of its existence as a national 
                  fraternity closed in 1919, plans were being mapped for a new 
                  era in the history of Tau Kappa Epsilon. 
                  
<p><STRONG>A Headquarters Is Created 
                  </STRONG>
<p>The advantage of a central office had 
                  for some time been apparent, and now, with 14 chapters and the 
                  prospects of comparatively rapid growth, its need was even 
                  more obvious. At the thirteenth Conclave in Madison, 
                  Wisconsin, April 22-23, 1921, the desirability of a 
                  headquarters was mentioned by several of the Grand Officers in 
                  their annual reports. It was Grand Grammateus Lloyd V. 
                  Ballard, however, who presented the matter so forcefully that 
                  the office of Grand Grammateus was expanded into a national 
                  Executive Secretary and a central office was created. Harrold 
                  P. "Tex" Flint, then retiring as Grand Prytanis, was elected 
                  to this position and became the first Executive Secretary. The 
                  central office was established in Frater Flint's home in 
                  Lombard, Illinois. 
                  
<p>With this change the affairs of the 
                  fraternity became better coordinated, a new national 
                  consciousness evolved, a centralized administration 
                  organization developed, and Tau Kappa Epsilon began to assume 
                  an importance and secure recognition in the fraternity world. 
                  
<p>William D. Reeve (Minnesota) was 
                  elected Grand Prytanis at the thirteenth Conclave, and was the 
                  first who was not an alumnus of Alpha. 
                  
<p>Frater Reeve presided over the 
                  fourteenth Conclave, held at Cedar Rapids, Iowa in 1922, at 
                  which "hazing" in fraternity initiation and pledging 
                  activities was soundly condemned. Phillip H. McGrath, 
                  (Millikin) was elected as the fraternity's national President 
                  at the fifteenth Conclave in St. Louis, October 24-25, 1923. 
                  

<p><STRONG>The Silver Anniversary 
</STRONG>
<p>The sixteenth Conclave in 1924 was set 
                  apart as the "Silver Jubilee Conclave," celebrating the 
                  twentyfifth anniversary of the founding of the fraternity. It 
                  was most appropriately held at Bloomington and was marked by 
                  the presence of all five of the Founders, who prepared a joint 
                  address. This Conclave also unveiled a tablet in the Chapel at 
                  Illinois Wesleyan University commemorating the founding of 
                  TKE. Life membership in the Grand Chapter was conferred upon 
                  the Founders. 
                  
<p>This Conclave selected Leland F. "Pete" 
                  Leland as Grand Histor, a position he was able to hold for 25 
                  continuous years. Leland, who was later chosen as president of 
                  the College Fraternity Editor's Association, served as editor 
                  of THE TEKE, building it to a position as one of the finest 
                  magazines in the fraternity world. National Founders 
                  
<p><STRONG>The Upward Climb </STRONG>
<p>The period 1921-26 saw 10 new chapters 
                  installed, completing the first alphabet, from Alpha to Omega. 
                  TKE was spreading from coast to coast, as evidenced by the 
                  chapters installed Omicron at Ohio State, Pi at Penn State, 
                  Rho at West Virginia, Sigma at Cornell, Tau at Oregon State, 
                  Upsilon at Michigan, Phi at Nebraska, Chi at the University of 
                  Washington, Psi at Gettysburg, and Omega at Albion. 
                  
<p>The years 1926-30 were ones of steady 
                  growth, expanding both east and west, under the leadership of 
                  Grand Prytanis Miles Gray in 1926-28 and Milton Olander in 
                  1928-30. Eight new chapters had been installed by the 
                  nineteenth Conclave in San Francisco, September 3-5, 1930, 
                  bringing the total chapter roll up to 32. This Conclave 
                  elected Eugene C. Beach as the eleventh Grand Prytanis. 
                  
<p>These years were also years of grief, 
                  as the entire fraternity mourned the passing of Founders Owen 
                  1. Truitt and C. Roy Atkinson. Both Founders died in auto 
                  accidents Truitt on July 13, 1929, and Atkinson on September 
                  14, 1930. 
                  
<p><STRONG>The Depression Years </STRONG>
<p>The five-year period, 1930-35, were 
                  trying years for the fraternity, as they were for the people 
                  and organizations throughout the nation. It was a struggle to 
                  keep the national organization functioning smoothly and the 
                  chapter roll intact under financial conditions which brought 
                  constantly shrinking financial support from all sources. 
                  Fraternity chapters of other nationals and even whole national 
                  fraternities were folding because of insufficient support, 
                  but, under the strong leadership of Grand Prytanis Beach and 
                  other devoted men of the fraternity, TKE weathered the storm 
                  and even progressed during this period. 
                  
<p>Eight new chapters were added during 
                  this period and many chapters pledged larger numbers of men 
                  each year. Only two chapters the University of Chicago and the 
                  University of Nebraska were not active following the 
                  Depression. Tau Kappa Epsilon also absorbed the membership of 
                  a small national, Sigma Mu Sigma, in 1934, but this resulted 
                  in only one new chapter, Alpha-Pi at George Washington 
                  University in D.C. 
                  
<p>The only Conclave held during these 
                  five years was in 1935 at the Hotel Baker in St. Charles, 
                  Illinois. This Conclave, which was postponed each year for 
                  financial reasons, instituted for the first time a program of 
                  addresses during the sessions and at lunches and dinners. 
                  However, the most significant measure adopted at this 
                  twentieth Conclave was the recognition of Lester H. Martin, L. 
                  W. Tuesburg, William Wilson, and Wallace G. McCauley for their 
                  dedicated and untiring efforts in the building of Tau Kappa 
                  Epsilon. These four men were named National Founders for their 
                  work in making TKE truly a "national" fraternity. 
                  
<p><STRONG>The Pre-War Years </STRONG>
<p>The years preceding the entry of the 
                  United States into the Second World War have been described as 
                  the "quiet interlude." The main emphasis was upon the 
                  balancing of the national budget and strengthening the 
                  undergraduate chapters. Don A. Fisher served as Grand Prytanis 
                  from 1935-37 and he was followed by Clarence E. Smith in 
                  1937-39. During this period only three new chapters were 
                  installed, although much progress was made in the internal 
                  organization of the fraternity. 
                  

<p>With war clouds on the horizon in 1939, 
                  Herbert Helble was elected Grand Prytanis. However, because of 
                  the pressure of other activities in this time of turmoil, 
                  Frater Helble resigned in 1941. L. W. Tuesburg, then Grand 
                  Epiprytanis, was elevated to the presidency, his second term 
                  as Grand Prytanis, serving until June 21, 1942. 
                  
<p>In 1941, Grand Grammateus "Tex" Flint 
                  resigned his office after 20 years of service. Housing the 
                  central office at first in his home, Frater Flint had moved 
                  the office to a new building in Lombard, Illinois in 1927 and 
                  maintained it there until 1941. With the resignation of Frater 
                  Flint, Past Grand Prytanis Lyle Straight was elected Grand 
                  Grammateus and the national office was moved to Bloomington, 
                  Illinois. 
                  
<p>Three new chapters were installed 
                  during this period, with Alpha-Chi Chapter at the University 
                  of Louisville being the last pre-war charter. 
                  
<p><STRONG>The Second World War </STRONG>
<p>Tau Kappa Epsilon spent most of the war 
                  years under the leadership of Grand Prytanis Charles E. 
                  Nieman. During the early years of the United States' 
                  involvement in the military conflict, TKE did not suffer 
                  greatly. In October, 1942, for example, TKE pledged 568 men as 
                  opposed to 475 pledges the preceding October. Also, during the 
                  year, 628 men were initiated into TKE and the fraternity's 
                  income was $26,505.47, both initiations and income being 
                  alltime highs. 
                  
<p>The severe manpower drain hit the 
                  colleges and the fraternity system in 1943, causing many 
                  chapters to go inactive and nearly all to abandon their 
                  houses. In September, 1943, only 19 of TKE's chapters were 
                  still active and only two Alpha-Zeta at Purdue and Alpha-Phi 
                  at Kansas still had houses. All the other chapter houses had 
                  been relinquished for the duration of the war. 
                  
<p>No Conclaves were held during the war 
                  period in conformity with governmental orders and also to 
                  conserve fraternity funds. While the fraternity continued to 
                  function, and continued to give essential services to both 
                  chapters and fraters, all expenses were cut to the bone. 
                  
<p>THE TEKE magazine was suspended during 
                  the war in favor of a less expensive newspaper called Teke 
                  Life. This paper was sent out to every Teke on record, 
                  regardless of subscription status, in order to help maintain 
                  the interest of Tekes everywhere during this period when many 
                  of their undergraduate chapters were dormant. 
                  
<p>For the first time the office of Grand 
                  Grammateus was separated from the duties of Executive 
                  Secretary and a part-time Executive Secretary was hired. Dr. 
                  E. L. Theiss, professor of accounting at the University of 
                  Illinois, assumed this position, hired a full-time secretary, 
                  and set up the National Office in Champaign, Illinois. In 
                  1945, Frater Theiss tendered his resignation and V. J. 
                  Hampton, Assistant Dean of Men at the University of Illinois, 
                  was hired as Executive Secretary. 
                  
<p><STRONG>The Big Decision </STRONG>
<p>At the beginning of the hostilities, 
                  the Grand Council of the fraternity faced a major policy 
                  decision whether the fraternity's limited financial resources 
                  should be exhausted in a futile attempt to keep all chapters 
                  active throughout the War or whether the fraternity should 
                  recognize the impossibility of that objective and concentrate 
                  on preparing an aggressive and effective rehabilitation and 
                  expansion program after the War. Luckily, the latter course 
                  was chosen. Subsequent events demonstrated the wisdom of that 
                  choice, but it was not so apparent when it was made. 
                  
<p>With so few chapters functioning during 
                  1943-45, the income upon which the fraternity depended to 
                  operate was drastically limited. To provide TKE with some 
                  security to prevent financial failure and to provide funds 
                  upon which to operate, the Teke Loyalty Fund was created. Into 
                  this fund loyal TKE alumni contributed nearly $30,000, without 
                  which the fraternity could not have surmounted the tremendous 
                  hurdles that appeared. Each alumnus was asked to contribute 
                  the small sum of $3.00 annually to provide a fund for post-war 
                  chapter reactivation and new installations. 
                  
<p><STRONG>Tekes in Uniform </STRONG>
<p>Tekes too numerous to mention were 
                  actively involved in the war effort. It was estimated that 54% 
                  of TKE's total membership wore the uniform of one of the 
                  services. Some of the more noteworthy military leaders 
                  included: 
                  

<p>Dr. Irving P. Krick, one of the world's 
                  leading meteorologists who set the date for Eisenhower's 
                  Normandy invasion; Major General Dan C. Ogle, Surgeon General 
                  of the Air Force; Rear Admiral R. C. Williams, Assistant 
                  Surgeon General of the U. S. Public Health Service; Brig. Gen. 
                  Glen C. McBridge; Brig. Gen. John C. P. Bartholf; Brig. Gen. 
                  Loyal M. Haynes; Brig. Gen. W. E. Chambers; and Brig. Gen. 
                  Hugh M. Milton. According to the best available data, 196 
                  Tekes gave their lives for their country and 30 received 
                  decorations exceeding that of the Bronze Star during World War 
                  II. 
                  
<p>Several changes in the composition of 
                  the Grand Council occurred during the "war years." Grand 
                  Epiprytanis Charles R. Walgreen, Jr. was required to resign in 
                  1943 because of business pressures when he assumed the 
                  presidency of the Walgreen Drug Store chain, and Grand 
                  Pylortes R. C. Williams was elevated to Grand Epiprytanis. 
                  When Grand Prytanis Nieman was also forced to resign because 
                  of professional and business activities in 1944, Frater 
                  Williams ascended. To this aggressive, dedicated TKE leader 
                  fell the massive task of leading the rehabilitation after the 
                  War. 
                  
<p><STRONG>Dr. Williams Takes Office 
                  </STRONG>
<p>When Dr. Williams assumed the office of 
                  Grand Prytanis in 1944, the United States was in the midst of 
                  its greatest military conflict. Tau Kappa Epsilon had only 11 
                  active chapters many with less than 10 members, and there was 
                  general unrest among many Tekes as to the future. 
                  
<p>Some TKE leaders felt that the 
                  fraternity had neither the resources nor the knowhow to 
                  survive , and advocated its dissolution or merger with another 
                  national. In fact, a merger was discussed with Kappa Delta 
                  Rho, another small national with 17 chapters, but the merger 
                  failed for lack of agreement on behalf of both parties. 
                  
<p>Frater Williams, however, held 
                  steadfastly to the belief that Tau Kappa Epsilon was 
                  constructed of a fiber that would not only survive the crisis 
                  but would be the leader in the fraternity world in the years 
                  to come. 
                  
<p>By the end of hostilities in 1945, the 
                  rehabilitation was already underway. Several chapters had been 
                  revived, bringing the total active chapter roll back up to 19. 
                  This year also saw the adoption of a plan, made possible by 
                  the Teke Loyalty Fund, of hiring Traveling Supervisors on a 
                  full-time basis. This plan, used successfully by Phi Gamma 
                  Delta, Sigma Chi, Lambda Chi Alpha, and a few other nationals, 
                  had been used on a very limited scale by TKE before the War, 
                  but this year marked the first real utilization of the 
                  program. These Traveling Supervisors, competent young men and 
                  recent graduates, were of inestimable value in reactivating 
                  dormant chapters, in training and indoctrinating the fraters 
                  of the active chapters, and in promoting the program of 
                  expansion that was to follow. The first post-war Traveling 
                  Supervisor, Robert Nelson, was actually working in the field 
                  less than a month after V-J Day. 
                  
<p><STRONG>Completed In Grand Fashion 
                  </STRONG>
<p>With as many as five Field Supervisors 
                  on the road at a time and with Dr. Williams and other Grand 
                  Officers working incessantly in the planning and organizing of 
                  the work to be done, the extensive tusk of rehabilitation was 
                  completed in grand fashion true to the belief of Frater 
                  Williams and to the amazement of some TKE leaders and the 
                  whole fraternity system. By September, 1949, every TKE 
                  chapter, except four, had been reactivated. And, in addition, 
                  28 new chapters had been installed, bringing TKE's active 
                  chapter roll to 70 chapters, its total initiates to nearly 
                  16,000, and its undergraduate members to over 3,000. 
                  
<p>Tau Kappa Epsilon had also, for the 
                  first time, penetrated the South. This move was made possible 
                  in the fall of 1946 when Alpha Lambda Tau, a small 
                  predominantly Southern national fraternity, announced its 
                  dissolution. Five of the then eight active chapters of Alpha 
                  Lambda Tau affiliated with TKE, giving Tau Kappa Epsilon 
                  chapters at the University of Maryland, North Carolina State, 
                  Auburn, Louisiana Tech, and Tri-State College in Indiana. On 
                  September 4-7, 1947, the twenty-fourth Conclave was held in 
                  Champaign, Illinois, the first Conclave since 1942. Dr. 
                  Williams was again elected, an endorsement of his program of 
                  growth and rehabilitation. In September, 1949, Frater Williams 
                  stepped down as Grand Prytanis after five years of service in 
                  that office, and Grand Histor Leland F. Leland was elected. 
                  With rapidly expanding college enrollments and with the 
                  fraternity's feet planted firmly on the ground, the future for 
                  TKE indeed looked bright. 
                  
<p><STRONG>The Fabulous Fifties </STRONG>
<p>The Golden Jubilee Conclave in Chicago, 
                  September 1-3, 1949, celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of 
                  the founding of the fraternity and marked the publication of 
                  The Golden Book of Tau Kappa Epsilon, a detailed history of 
                  the first 50 years of the fraternity, compiled by Leland F. 
                  Leland. 
                  
<p>This Conclave was attended by Founders 
                  James C. McNutt and Clarence A. Mayer. Founder Joseph L. 
                  Settles had died on February 15, 1943. 
                  
<p><STRONG>To 160 Chapters </STRONG>

<p>Entering the 1950's, Tau Kappa Epsilon 
                  began a period of dynamic growth never before equalled in the 
                  history of the fraternity system. At the close of 1949, 50 
                  years after the founding of the fraternity, Tau Kappa Epsilon 
                  had granted a total of 79 charters, 75 of which were active, 
                  and had initiated a total of 15,954 men. Ten years later, at 
                  the close of this decade, TKE's charter grants totaled 168, of 
                  which 160 were active and functioning, and the total initiates 
                  numbered 39,065. In just ten years, Tau Kappa Epsilon had more 
                  than doubled its size and had risen from a very insignificant 
                  position in the fraternity world to that of a leader in all 
                  aspects. 
                  
<p>Such a rise in power was possible only 
                  through the dynamic leadership of a succession of Grand 
                  Prytanis and National Officers dedicated to the principle that 
                  strength emanates from growth, aided by an increasingly 
                  efficient national organization, and by the detailed planning 
                  and devoted service of TKE leaders obsessed with the desire to 
                  make Tau Kappa Epsilon the number one fraternity in the 
                  country. 
                  
<p>Grand Prytanis during this expansion of 
                  the fraternity were Leland F. Leland (1949-51), Sophus C. Goth 
                  (1951-53), James C. Logan (1953-57), and Frank B. Scott 
                  (1957-59). For their efforts and devoted service during the 
                  growth period of the fraternity since World War II, Fraters 
                  Williams, Leland, Logan, and Scott were named Expansion 
                  Leaders. 
                  
<p>During Frater Leland's administration, 
                  extensive revision of the national constitution and bylaws was 
                  successfully completed. This long-needed overhaul of the basic 
                  laws of the fraternity was officially approved and adopted at 
                  the 1951 Conclave by the passage sage of over a hundred 
                  separate amendments. One of the significant changes made at 
                  this Conclave was the establishment of the office of Grand 
                  Hegemon and the adoption of a plan for national leadership 
                  conferences. 
                  
<p><STRONG>Leadership Conferences 
</STRONG>
<p>Anticipating the development of a 
                  strong national leadership conference program, Grand Prytanis 
                  Leland appointed Howard L. Hibbs, then a regional officer, to 
                  head the first national leadership conference. This school for 
                  undergraduate chapter officers was successfully held the day 
                  before the formal opening of the 1951 Conclave , and started 
                  the precedent l for national leadership conferences preceding 
                  or during each Conclave. These schools are in addition to the 
                  annual regional leadership conferences which have long been 
                  utilized by TKE. 
                  
<p>Frater Leland was succeeded as Grand 
                  Prytanis at the twentysixth Conclave, held in Roanoke, 
                  Virginia, by Grand Epiprytanis Goth, a long-time member of the 
                  Grand Council. During Frater Leland's term of office, 20 new 
                  chapters were installed and Tau Chapter at Oregon State, one 
                  of the four chapters to become dormant during the Depression 
                  and war years, was reactivated. 
                  
<p><STRONG>The Korean War </STRONG>
<p>During Frater Goth's term of office, 
                  with the outbreak of hostilities in Korea, college enrollments 
                  took a nose dive. TKE's growth, as a result, was greatly 
                  curtailed. In spite of this fraternity recession, however, Tau 
                  Kappa Epsilon granted its 100th charter to an undergraduate 
                  chapter on 28, 1953, when Delta Delta Tau, a local fraternity 
                  at Colorado State College, Greeley, was installed as 
                  Delta-Delta Chapter. 
                  
<p>This important milestone in TKE history 
                  was commemorated by the publication of a special issue of THE 
                  TEKE, reviewing the history of TKE growth and development from 
                  that day in 1909 when Tau Kappa Epsilon was launched forth on 
                  its national career. 
                  
<p>Nine new chapters were installed during 
                  Frater Goth's term. 
                  
<p><STRONG>Housing Fund Established 
                  </STRONG>
<p>James C. Logan, a Kansas City attorney, 
                  was elected Grand Prytanis at the twenty-seventh Conclave held 
                  during September, 1953, at the Hotel Savery, Des Moines, Iowa. 
                  During Frater Logan's two-term stint in this office, 44 new 
                  chapters were installed and a national housing fund was 
                  established to provide loans to undergraduate chapters for the 
                  construction and purchase of fraternity houses. At the 
                  twenty-eighth Conclave at the Hotel President and Municipal 
                  Auditorium, Kansas City, Missouri, in September, 1955, Frater 
                  Logan was re-elected Grand Prytanis and the corporate seal 
                  used on charters and certificates was officially adopted. 
                  
<p>In 1956, Richard R. Hall became 
                  Executive Secretary and the National Office was moved to 
                  Kansas City. The office of Executive Secretary thus became a 
                  fulltime administrative position. 
                  

<p>The twenty-ninth Conclave in August, 
                  1957, at Bedford Springs, Pennsylvania, chose Grand 
                  Epiprytanis Frank B. Scott to head the fraternity. During 
                  Frater Scott's administration, 21 new chapters were installed, 
                  two of which were of special importance. Canadian Alpha colony 
                  at the University of Manitoba became Zeta-Iota Chapter on 
                  Murch 15, 1958, making TKE an international fraternity. For 
                  his efforts in securing TKE's first Canadian chapter, Bruce B. 
                  Melchert was named International Founder by Grand Prytanis 
                  Logan. Frater Melchert also holds the Order of the Silver 
                  Maple Leaf, an award presented by Zeta-lota Chapter 
                  recognizing men who give service to TKE in Canada. 
                  
<p>On April 4, 1959, Zeta-Omicron Chapter 
                  was installed at Western Carolina College, Cullowhee, North 
                  Carolina. This event was a landmark in that it made Tau Kappa 
                  Epsilon the largest social fraternity in the world. 
                  
<p><STRONG>The Solid Sixties </STRONG>
<p>As Tau Kappa Epsilon entered the decade 
                  of the 1960's, it had assumed a position of vital importance 
                  in the fraternity world. TKE was now the largest fraternity 
                  with more than 160 chapters and was a leader in all aspects of 
                  interfraternity competition. This decade was to bring about 
                  continued growth along with a solidification of fraternity 
                  policies, procedures, and operations. 
                  
<p>Don Kaser, a veteran of ten years of 
                  service on the Grand Council, was elected Grand Prytanis at 
                  the thirtieth Conclave at the Sheraton-Cadillac Hotel in 
                  Detroit, September 1-5, 1959. Frater Kaser's administration 
                  saw 41 new chapters installed, the most significant being the 
                  200th charter to lota-Theta Chapter at Centenary College, 
                  Shreveport, Louisiana, on March 24, 1963. TKE thus become the 
                  first fraternity to install 200 chapters, a goal long 
                  considered impossible. 
                  
<p>Under the leadership of Frater Kaser, 
                  Tau Kappa Epsilon achieved a position of solid financial 
                  stability; dedicated its first permanent International 
                  Headquarters building; and formulated and instigated new 
                  programs becoming that of the largest and most progressive 
                  fraternity. 
                  
<p>The thirty-first Conclave at the Roney 
                  Plaza in Miami Beach, Florida, September, 1961, greatly aided 
                  the fraternity's fiscal operations by eliminating the monthly 
                  dues procedure and adopting the single initiation fee. 
                  Increased operating efficiency, plus sound financial 
                  management, enabled the fraternity to repay all reserve funds 
                  in full by 1962 operating on an annual budget in excess of 
                  $300,000. 
                  
<p>In 1960 Bruce B. Melchert, CFC, became 
                  Executive Director, and the fraternity office, or Offices of 
                  the Grand Chapter as it is appropriately known, was moved to 
                  Indianapolis, Indiana, during 1961. The Offices of the Grand 
                  Chapter building in Indianapolis, contains the offices of the 
                  Executive Director and the administrative staff, and houses 
                  the files, records, and equipment of the fraternity. 
                  
<p>Among the many new dimensional goals 
                  formulated was the establishment of a TKE placement service to 
                  aid fraters in obtaining employment. 
                  
<p><STRONG>McNutt And Mayer Die </STRONG>
<p>The 1960's marked the passing of the 
                  final two Founders of Tau Kappa Epsilon. Clarence A. Mayer 
                  succumbed to a heart attack in Los Angeles on August 8, 1960, 
                  and Dr. James C. McNutt closed a brilliant page in history 
                  when he passed away on May 18, 1962, in Bloomington, Illinois 
                  at the age of 83. Both men, as were all five of the Founders, 
                  were active in the fraternity until their death. Their loss 
                  was a keen one to TKE. 
                  
<p>The thirty-second Conclave, held in 
                  August, 1963, at the Marriott Hotel in Indianapolis, marked 
                  the election of l. Russel Salsbury as Grand Prytanis and the 
                  dedication of the Offices of the Grand Chapter building. 
                  
<p><STRONG>Salsbury Re-Elected </STRONG>
<p>Salsbury was re-elected at the 1965 
                  Conclave at Toronto, Ontario, the first outside the United 
                  States. During his terms he directed TKE as it began to 
                  realize the benefits of its size and rank. The Offices of the 
                  Grand Chapter staff was enlarged to include a Chapter Services 
                  Director, an Alumni Director, and a Publications Director. The 
                  largest staff of traveling supervisors in the fraternity world 
                  was on the road, and several resident supervisors were hired 
                  for full-time work in problem chapters. 
                  

<p>The fraternity finances were brought up 
                  to date as a taxexempt foundation was started and incorporated 
                  as the Teke Educational Foundation, Inc., and the housing fund 
                  incorporated as the TKE House Fund, Inc. An alumni dues 
                  program was begun to supplement the fraternity's income. 
                  
<p>The fraternity began to take steps to 
                  preserve its history as a very active history committee, 
                  composed mainly of National Founder L. W. Tuesburg, Grand 
                  Histor Emeritus Leland, and Past Grand Prytanis "Tex" Flint, 
                  began to write down their memories. This resulted in the 
                  publication of "The Reminiscences of L. W. Tuesburg" in 1963 
                  and a history of the 1899 to 1915 period in 1966. 
                  
<p>The most important legislation of the 
                  1965 Conclave was the Board of Directors concept, the result 
                  of four years of study by the Administrative Survey 
                  Commission. Under this concept, many of the routine duties 
                  traditionally done by a Grand Officer have been assigned to 
                  the Offices of the Grand Chapter staff. The Grand Prytanis 
                  (President), the Grand Grammateus (Secretary), and the Grand 
                  Crysophylos (Treasurer), still retain their basic duties as 
                  officers of the fraternity, but the other Grand Officers do 
                  special projects as assigned by the Grand Prytanis. 
                  
<p>To handle many of the routine tasks 
                  which the Offices of the Grand Chapter assumed, TKE was the 
                  second fraternity to convert to an electronic data processing 
                  system. Most of the financial and membership records have been 
                  converted to high speed data processing form. 
                  
<p><STRONG>The Fraternity For Life 
                  Film</STRONG>
<p>The TKE public relations and rush film 
                  premiered at the Toronto Conclave. It is the first fraternity 
                  film produced by Hollywood professionals, and featured 
                  undergraduates from Kansas, Missouri, and California, and 
                  alumni Ronald Reagan and Stan Kenton, in a 15-minute color and 
                  sound film. The film was planned by Public Relations 
                  Commission Chairman George Woolery and Executive Director 
                  Bruce Melchert. 
                  
<p>In another effort to improve the image 
                  of TKE and the fraternity system, the fraternity planned its 
                  first Public Service Week in 1966. The week was a great 
                  success with more participation and more good publicity than 
                  its creators ever imagined. It has been adopted as an annual 
                  project. 
                  
<p><STRONG>A Sorrowful Year </STRONG>
<p>1966 was a great year as the fraternity 
                  continued its growth in membership, chapter strength, and 
                  stability but it was also a sorrowful year as three great 
                  leaders died. 
                  
<p>Past Grand Prytanis "Tex" Flint died 
                  February 21, Grand Prytanis Emeritus L. W. Tuesburg died June 
                  10, and incumbent Grand Prytanis J. Russel Salsbury died June 
                  3. Salsbury was the first Grand Prytanis to die during his 
                  term. 
                  
<p>Salsbury was succeeded by Donald H. 
                  Becker, who pledged himself to continue the policies and 
                  fulfill the goals of his predecessor. 
                  
<p><STRONG>A Solidification </STRONG>
<p>The 1960's have also brought a 
                  solidification in the number and quality of fraternity houses 
                  owned by TKE chapters. The 1963 NIC Yearbook listed Tau Kappa 
                  Epsilon as owning 165 houses, far more than any other national 
                  fraternity. In 1969, it was revealed that the TKE House Fund, 
                  Inc., created in 1953, had loaned money to over 134 chapters 
                  to buy, build, or improve their physical facilities and had a 
                  total worth of over $ 1,000,000. 
                  
<p><STRONG>Into The Seventies</STRONG>

<p>At the 1967 Conclave, Grand Prytanis 
                  Becker was elected to the first of two terms in that office. 
                  In his "State of the Fraternity" address at the Grand Bahamas 
                  Conclave, Becker talked about continued growth for the 
                  fraternity tied to the growth in fraternity services to 
                  support these additional chapters. At this time when there was 
                  a good deal of talk about the impending death of fraternities, 
                  Tau Kappa Epsilon was growing faster than ever in history. In 
                  the 1967-68 academic year, 14 new chapters were installed. 
                  This tied the previous one-year record which TKE had 
                  established. Then, in the 1968-69 school year, 22 new chapters 
                  were installed and two dormant chapters were reactivated, an 
                  accomplishment many believed impossible. During this period, 
                  in-depth evaluations were taking place as leaders sought new 
                  and better programs to meet the needs of students in a 
                  changing world. The "Retreat" concept was born during this 
                  period with members encouraged to plan the future of their 
                  chapter through pre established goals. Chapter Advisor 
                  Conferences came into being in 1969 to give more information 
                  to Advisors. Believing that the Chapter Advisor is a "key man 
                  for success," a number of services were directed toward 
                  preparing the Chapter Advisor for his responsibilities with 
                  the chapter. In addition, Regional Leadership Conferences were 
                  pro grammed for participation of members, as was the College 
                  of Leadership and Chapter Management at Conclave. 
                  
<p><STRONG>Decade Of Innovation </STRONG>
<p>In 1970 TKE reached another significant 
                  milestone with the installation of our 300th chapter (Nu-Mu) 
                  at the University of South Alabama. 
                  
<p>At the 1971 Conclave in Asheville, 
                  North Carolina, then Grand Epiprytanis Lenwood Cochran 
                  succeeded Donald H. Becker as Grand Prytanis of our 
                  fraternity. The ritual of the Fraternity was updated at this 
                  Conclave. The new ritual keeps the spirit and meaning of the 
                  original, but arranges it in a more usable form with modern 
                  language. 
                  
<p><STRONG>New Headquarters 
                  Opened</STRONG>
<p>A major goal was reached in January, 
                  1972, with the opening of the new TKE Headquarters at 8645 
                  Founders Road in Indianapolis, Indiana. The new headquarters 
                  was the first built by the fraternity, and was the culmination 
                  of years of dreams and plans. In 1973 T. J. Schmitz, CFC, was 
                  confirmed as the new Executive Vice President succeeding Bruce 
                  B. Melchert, CFC, who left the professional staff after 15 
                  years of dedicated service. 
                  
<p><STRONG>Diamond Anniversary</STRONG>
<p>At the 1973 Conclave in Indianapolis, 
                  Grand Epiprytanis William A. Quallich succeeded retiring Grand 
                  Prytanis Lenwood S. Cochran. At this Conclave an "associate 
                  member" program was adopted which replaces traditional pledge 
                  education or pledge training. The Indianapolis Conclave marked 
                  the beginning of our 75th anniversary year which was 
                  highlighted by a Diamond Anniversary celebration and banquet 
                  on January 12, 1974, at Bloomington, Illinois, the site of our 
                  founding in 1899. Bronze markers were emplaced on each of the 
                  graves of the five Founders who began The Knights of Classic 
                  Lore, the fraternity of Illinois Wesleyan which later became 
                  Tau Kappa Epsilon. 
                  
<p>At the 1975 Conclave, held at the Lake 
                  Geneva Playboy Club, Grand Epiprytanis William H. Wisdom, CFC, 
                  was elected Grand Prytanis, succeeding William A. Quallich. 
                  During his administration, the fraternity moved forward with a 
                  number of innovations including the purchase of a new computer 
                  for the Offices of the Grand Chapter. TKE was the second 
                  fraternity to convert to electronic data processing in the 
                  1960's. The addition of this new equipment allowed all of the 
                  fraternity's financial and membership records to be converted 
                  to high-speed data processing. 1975 also saw the return of TKE 
                  to the National Interfraternity Conference, the umbrella 
                  organization of the fraternity movement. 
                  
<p><STRONG>Long Range Planning</STRONG>
<p>In 1976, Tau Kappa Epsilon became one 
                  of the first fraternities to implement a long range planning 
                  approach. The first five-year plan was presented during one of 
                  the most exciting Conclaves in the fraternity's history, held 
                  in 1977 at the Fairmont Hotel in the French Quarter of 
                  historic New Orleans. The 1977 Conclave was the first time 
                  that chartered alumni associations were eligible to 
                  participate in the affairs of the Grand Chapter. At this 
                  Conclave, Frater Robert H. Nelson delivered the report of the 
                  Long Range Planning Committee, which was charged with the 
                  responsibility of developing policy recommendations for 
                  insuring the continued success of our fraternity. Another 
                  innovative concept unveiled at this Conclave was the Grand 
                  Chapter Policy on Chapter Standards. The New Orleans Conclave 
                  included the installation of Dr. William V. Muse, CFC, as 
                  Grand Prytanis, succeeding William H. Wisdom. 
                  
<p>In 1979, Tau Kappa Epsilon held its 
                  40th Conclave in French Lick, Indiana. One of the highlights 
                  of the 1979 Conclave was a trip to Louisville, Kentucky and a 
                  ride on the riverboat, the "Belle of Louisville." A bold new 
                  philanthropic program centered around the TKE Keg Roll was 
                  implemented in 1979. Grand Epiprytanis Rodney Williams, Jr., 
                  CFC, was elected as the 28th Grand Prytanis. 
                  

<p><STRONG>The 80's - Focus On 
                  Excellence</STRONG>
<p>In 1981, the 41st Biennial Conclave of 
                  Tau Kappa Epsilon was held at the Hotel Roanoke in Roanoke, 
                  Virginia. This event marked a historic return to a very 
                  special Conclave site. Thirty years previously, TKE had 
                  celebrated the 26th Conclave in the Hotel Roanoke. The theme 
                  of "Reach Out . . ." was emphasized as a challenge to all 
                  members of Tau Kappa Epsilon to build on the great traditions 
                  of the fraternity and does place a special focus on excellence 
                  in the decade of the 1980's. Grand Epiprytanis John A. 
                  Courson, CFC, was elected Grand Prytanis at this Conclave, 
                  succeeding the retiring Grand Prytanis Rodney Williams, Jr. 
                  
<p>Tau Kappa Epsilon unveiled a number of 
                  new programs and concepts in 1982. A special program of 
                  Regional Leadership Conferences was added to the already 
                  existing schedule of District Leadership Conferences. A 
                  greater focus on alumni involvement and volunteers was 
                  introduced as part of the dynamic new Regional Servicing 
                  Program. Full-color recruitment posters, buttons, brochures 
                  and special slide presentations were introduced as part of a 
                  comprehensive national marketing theme, "TKE . . . The Winning 
                  Tradition." 
                  
<p>In 1983, the 42nd Biennial Conclave was 
                  held at the Fairmont Hotel in New Orleans, Louisiana. The 
                  theme for this conclave was "Tradition of Excellence." Grand 
                  Epiprytanis Dwayne R. Woerpel, CFC, was installed as TKE's 
                  30th Grand Prytanis. An exciting highlight of this Conclave 
                  was the conclusion of the TKE Keg Roll V during a special 
                  celebration in the New Orleans Superdome. In addition, the 
                  first Ronald Reagan Leadership Award was presented to Frater 
                  Rex Davis, an alumnus of Beta-Psi Chapter at Arkansas State 
                  University. 
                  
<p>One of TKE's most historic events took 
                  place on March 23, 1984, when an impressive group of TKE 
                  leaders gathered for a special fraternal celebration at the 
                  White House in Washington, D.C. Frater Ronald Reagan, a 
                  lifelong supporter of Tau Kappa Epsilon, was awarded the NIC 
                  Gold Medal, the highest award among fraternities, for his 
                  lifelong efforts to support and promote college fraternities. 
                  In addition, Grand Prytanis Dwayne R. Woerpel presented Frater 
                  Reagan with the Order of the Golden Eagle, the highest award 
                  in Tau Kappa Epsilon, for his exemplary lifelong commitment to 
                  our fraternity and for his many efforts to assist and promote 
                  TKE. 
                  
<p>Orlando, Florida was the site of the 
                  43rd Conclave. Held on August 17-20, 1985, this Conclave 
                  included the kick-off of the Second Century Endowment of the 
                  TEF Campaign. This aggressive fundraising program was 
                  developed to insure the financial future of Tau Kappa Epsilon. 

                  
<p>Frater Joel E. Johnson, CFC, was 
                  installed as the new Grand Prytanis. The Order of the Golden 
                  Eagle was given posthumously to Frater Harry F. Donnelly. 
                  Frater Donnelly was a founder of the Teke Educational 
                  Foundation. The new "America's Fraternity" theme campaign was 
                  introduced, and many fraters enjoyed "TKE Day" at Walt Disney 
                  World. 
                  
<p>The 44th Conclave was held at the Grand 
                  Hyatt on August 19-2Z, 1987 in Washington, D.C. The new 
                  Fraternity theme "For Winners Only" was unveiled and fraters 
                  enjoyed the sights and sounds of our nation's capital. This 
                  "Capitol Conclave" was the largest in TKE history with more 
                  than 900 fraters and friends in attendance. Guests enjoyed a 
                  TKE tour of the White House, arranged by Frater Ronald Reagan 
                  especially for the Fraternity. Frater Bruce B. Melchert, CFC, 
                  was elected as our new Grand Prytanis. 
                  
<p>As the eighties came to a close, 
                  fraternities were closely scrutinized by college and 
                  university officials. Injuries and deaths from hazing 
                  incidents cast a dark shadow upon the Greek system. Several 
                  schools banned fraternities, and others established committees 
                  to look at the future of Greek life on campus, with more soon 
                  to follow. 
                  
<p>After careful study, Tau Kappa Epsilon 
                  proposed a bold new approach to membership development. 
                  Although the Associate Member Program was a vast improvement 
                  over traditional pledging, it was felt that more needed to be 
                  done. As long as the new member was perceived as a 
                  second-class citizen, the potential for hazing existed. 
                  
<p>TKE created the Membership Development 
                  Program as a bold new move to perpetuate the Fraternity for 
                  Life. The traditional pledge period was replaced with an 
                  educational program designed to continue long after 
                  traditional pledgeship would have ended. Candidates for 
                  membership had to pass a review by a Membership Quality Board, 
                  ensuring that all new members met chapter standards. Standards 
                  regarding scholarship, leadership, member duties, and others 
                  were set by each chapter. A professionally produced series of 
                  videotapes, known as The Spirit of TKE", supplemented the 
                  learning experience. These tapes covered all areas of chapter 
                  management, fraternity history, operations, and other vital 
                  topics. Unlike the Associate Member" period of days past, the 
                  Membership Development Program offered ongoing education 
                  throughout an undergraduate's career. Special levels of 
                  achievement were designated to recognize continuing 
                  participation in fraternal, campus, and community affairs. 
                  
<p>At the 45th Conclave in Indianapolis, 
                  Indiana, on August 19, 1989, the Membership Development 
                  Program was endorsed by the Grand Chapter. Pledging become 
                  part of TKE's history. This historic event brought national 
                  attention to Tau Kappa Epsilon, once again taking the 
                  leadership role in the fraternity system. Frater James S. 
                  Margolin was installed as our 48th Grand Prytanis. 
                  
<p><STRONG>A Reflection And 
                  Summary</STRONG>
<p>Historians tell us that the history of 
                  a notion reflects the fiber of the people who have composed 
                  it how they have reacted to crises, overcome obstacles, and 
                  developed over a long period of time. It is likely, then, that 
                  the caliber of a fraternity can in some way be measured by 
                  viewing its history in the proper perspective. 
                  
<p>The first 50 years for Tau Kappa 
                  Epsilon--- from its founding in 1899 to 1949--- were years of 
                  steady, yet slow, development. It was a period in which the 
                  obstacles were not small--- two world wars, the Great 
                  Depression, and competition with national fraternities who 
                  were 50 years older. 
                  

<p>These crises were encountered by TKE, 
                  not as a large, financially secure organization, but as a 
                  young, struggling fraternity. Not establishing its second 
                  chapter until 1909, TKE entered World War I with only 10 
                  chapters and a total membership of just over 700. Likewise, 
                  World War II hit TKE when it had only 38 active chapters and a 
                  membership of less than 10,000. 
                  
<p>It is not likely that Tau Kappa Epsilon 
                  would have surmounted these hurdles and many others without 
                  the competent leadership and devoted service of men like 
                  Lester H. Martin, William Wilson, L. W. Tuesburg, Wallace G. 
                  McCauley, Harrold P. Flint, Eugene C. Beach, Leland F. Leland, 
                  Dr. R. C. Williams, and many others. 
                  
<p>It was TKE's Founders, however, who 
                  provided the inspiration upon which the fraternity was built. 
                  They dared to be unique unique in their vision, foresight, 
                  ideals, and principles. They gave Tau Kappa Epsilon the spirit 
                  of genuine democracy and challenged the fraternity to choose 
                  men not for their wealth, rank, or honor, but for their 
                  personal worth and character. They left the fraternity with a 
                  priceless heritage and challenged Tekes everywhere to climb 
                  the mountain peaks of human achievement. 
                  
<p>In spite of this priceless heritage 
                  that is built into the first 50 years of its existence, Tau 
                  Kappa Epsilon was still a small, somewhat insignificant, 
                  fraternity in 1949. It has been only since World War II that 
                  TKE has gained the power, prestige, and importance it now 
                  possesses. 
                  
<p>Therefore, TKE, although founded at a 
                  somewhat early date, is still a youthful fraternity in the age 
                  of its chapters. More than 80 percent of the chapters have 
                  been installed since 1947. Competing with its senior 
                  fraternities throughout the United States and Canada, Tau 
                  Kappa Epsilon has demonstrated a competitive spirit, vitality, 
                  and ability to succeed seldom found in the fraternity world. 
                  
<p>According to the College Survey Bureau, 
                  an independent organization that rates college fraternities 
                  and sororities, only 24% of TKE's chapters ranked in the upper 
                  half of the groups on their campus in 1948. However, by 1955 
                  this percentage had been raised to 39% and in 1966, following 
                  that decade of dynamic growth, 64% of the TKE chapters were 
                  ranked in the upper half. By 1978, 76% of chapters were upper 
                  half. In total national strength--- a College Survey Bureau 
                  index based on size times quality--- Tau Kappa Epsilon moved 
                  from 11th place among fraternities in 1956 to 1st place in 
                  1966 and has remained first ever since. 
                  
<p>TKE's post-war growth has not been a 
                  wild surge but has rather been a long sustained forward march. 
                  During the 17-year period from 1947 through 1963, a total of 
                  165 new chapters were installed an average of 9.7 chapters per 
                  year, with the largest numbers installed in any one year being 
                  13. Further evidence of the strength attained by this growth 
                  can be seen by a review of other statistics. From 1947-63, the 
                  number of undergraduate members and pledges rose from 1,870 to 
                  10,546 and the average chapter size increased from 38 to 53 
                  men per chapter. The number of men initiated per year 
                  increased from 1,542 to 4,163 and the total initiates rose 
                  from 12,589 in 1947 to 62,262 in 1965. By 1969 that number had 
                  exceeded 80,000 and on March 20, 1972, James T. Slavin, Jr., 
                  of Alpha-Gamma Chapter at Washington State University, became 
                  the 100,000th initiate of TKE. 
                  
<p>Today, Tau Kappa Epsilon's leadership 
                  in the fraternity world is evident. The largest college social 
                  fraternity, TKE has almost 300 active chapters and colonies, 
                  in excess of 9,000 undergraduate members, and 155,000 
                  alumni--- all feats which have been accomplished in a 
                  remarkably short period of time. 
                  
<p>Tau Kappa Epsilon has gained this 
                  position of strength not by luck or lowered standards but by 
                  detailed planning, devoted service, and inspired leadership. 
                  Also instrumental in its success has been a "pioneering" 
                  spirit that has characterized TKE from its beginning and 
                  farsighted leaders who have had the fortitude to accept the 
                  challenge of the unknown. Able to foresee the expanding 
                  college enrollments of the future, TKE was the first large 
                  national fraternity to expand into small state colleges, many 
                  of whom are now major state universities. 
                  
<p><STRONG>The Future</STRONG>
<p>What does the future hold for TKE? With 
                  Tau Kappa Epsilon just now reaching maturity as an 
                  organization, one cannot feel but that the years ahead will be 
                  bright. 
                  
<p>Further growth and progress can be 
                  expected. TKE leaders are not likely to stand still amidst 
                  changing times. The late Grand Prytanis Dan Kaser, speaking at 
                  the 32nd Conclave in 1963, said: 
                  
<p>"TKE has been fortunate to have leaders 
                  who foresaw, at an early date, the increase in college 
                  population. Our growth has paralleled that of increasing 
                  enrollments, thus placing TKE in an enviable position among 
                  our fellow fraternities. We should continue this selective 
                  growth so long as there are colleges and universities capable 
                  of meeting our standards. " 
                  
<p>Further service to individual chapters, 
                  undergraduate members, and alumni will be evident even more 
                  efficient administration, modern computer hardware and 
                  software, and the latest methods of operation, pioneering 
                  programs such as placement service, undergraduate 
                  scholarships, public service projects, and scholastic and 
                  intellectual programs; and, above all, the devoted service of 
                  competent leaders. 
                  
<p>A priceless heritage, an unparalleled 
                  record of growth and progress, a bright and promising future . 
                  . . this is <br />
TAU KAPPA EPSILON.</p>
