<center><h3><b>Rush TKE!</b></h3><center/> 
 
<p>A college fraternity provides a young man with the opportunity to learn how to work together with people, whether
it be for the highest grades, the best homecoming float, a community service project, or merely to keep the house
clean. A fraternity provides a unique combination: family, home away from home, social organization, business and
organization, in which students can develop confidence as they acquire competence.</p> 
 
<p>Rush is the time in Fall (Formal Rush) set aside for undergraduates to learn more about, and if they choose to do so,
join a fraternity. There is also Spring Rush (Informal Rush) for students who have decided they too want to become
part of a life-changing experience.</p> 
<h2><b>Academics</b></h2><center/> 

<p>Greek students actually out preform non-Greek students. A U.S. Government study shows that over 70% of all those who join a fraternity/ sorority graduate, while under 50% of all non-fraternity/ sorority persons graduate. Some fraternities (including TKE) require their members to receive and maintain a certain GPA through out their stay, otherwise they are forced into probation and maybe even kicked out of the fraternity if they stay below the minimum GPA for to long.</p>
<h2><b>Leadership</b></h2><center/> 
<p>The Greek life turns little boys into full grown men then turns the men into the future leaders of America. The fraternities do so by giving all the members in their houses the ability to hold positions such as President, vice president, recruiter, treasurer, and new member educator, which in the end allows them to have some power in the house and to advance their skills. The next thing you know you are leading some company or even the entire country like many other people who were Greek at some point in their life.</p>
<h2><b>Career Networking</b></h2><center/> 
<p>Everybody now days knows how hard it is to find a job with the economy not doing the best and especially coming right out of college. Joining a fraternity can make your life after college, so much easier than it has to be, because of all the alumni of the fraternity that have already taken the exact same steps that you are taking or going to take. You might be thinking what can they do for you. Well some fraternities (including TKE) have mentor programs that partner up the current members and the alumni to try to guide the members in the right direction. Also the fraternities always try their hardest to get in touch with the alumni each year to try to get their graduating members a job in their company.</p>
