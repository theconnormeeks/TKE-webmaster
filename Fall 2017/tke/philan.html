<p>The Pi-Epsilon Chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon prides itself in its philanthropic efforts. In the spring semester of 2010 alone, the active members were able to raise $213.00 per man and completed 74 service hours per man. <br /><br />
The dollars raised and hours completed, went to the worthy organizations of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, The Alzheimer’s Association of America, and The Dream Factory of Memphis. <br /><br />
  The International Headquarters of Tau Kappa Epsilon recognizes both St. Jude and the Alzheimer’s Association as official TKE philanthropies. Each year we serve hundreds of hours and donate thousands of dollars to these charitable organizations.<br /><br />
  However, the Pi-Epsilon Chapter prides itself in its diligent work with the Dream Factory of Memphis. The “Nite of Life” initiative is a Pi-Epsilon tradition that allows us to promote a small, local charity is an extremely rewarding experience. In the spring semester of 2010 we were able to present a check for $7500.00 to the Dream Factory, the largest in the history of the event.<br /><br />
  Needless to say we are the most prominent and charitable social fraternity at Christian Brothers University. </p><br />
